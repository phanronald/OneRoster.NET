	/// Users, Teachers and Students are human beings that are teaching or studying in a class respectively. LIS represents these with Person. 
	/// For the case of binding, it is proposed that a single User class is used to represent both teachers and students, and that a role 
	/// element be used to distinguish a user's natural role. In the rest binding to follow, it is possible to select teachers and students 
	/// within a school, course or class. In LIS, users have an "institution role" set within the person record to identify their (primary) 
	/// role.  Note that this requirement is expanded to introduce other types of human: parents, guardians, relatives and aides.  
	/// Humans may have relationships with other humans.For example, a student may have parents.The "agents" attribute allows for relationships between humans to be expressed. Note that these are typically from the point of view of the student - so a student will link to its parents (via the agent attribute). The reverse view MUST also be modeled, so for example, a user of role "parent" MUST have agents that are of type "student".
	/// Note: Teachers MUST NOT be set as agents of students -the teaching relationship is covered via enrollments

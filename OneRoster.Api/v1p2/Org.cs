	/// ORG is defined here as a structure for holding organizational information. An ORG might be a school, or it might be a local, statewide, 
	/// or national entity. ORGs will typically have a parent ORG (up to the national level), and children, allowing a hierarchy to be 
	/// established. School is defined here as the place where the learning happens.Most commonly this is the data that describes a bricks and 
	/// mortar building, or, in the case of a virtual school, the virtual school organization. For enrollment and result reporting purposes, 
	/// little information about this organization is required.Later versions of the specification could add further information, such as an 
	/// address, for example.A common example of a local organization is a school district.Note that although School is a type of org, the 
	/// default entry point for requests in most places will be a school. The API provides many school based entry points, whilst still 
	/// allowing for more generic reading of ORGs, for those applications that need to.
